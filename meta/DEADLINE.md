My App allows users to search for weathers in different cities.
It then displays three peices of information: the temperature in
farheniet, an image of the city, and an image of the current
weather conditions. It uses 3 API calls, one to find the
lan/long coordinates, the next uses those coordinates to
get the weather conditions and temperature, and the final one
uses that to get the respectful imgaes. If there is a invalid input
from the user, the program will display an error message to the
user.


## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned about API keys and why they are useful in programing.
I also learned how to implement them in java.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> you think might do differently and why?

I may try writing it from frontend first to understand the layout and
the components I am working with better to connect to the backend.
